# stac-mjx
Implementation of STAC using MJX for GPU acceleration. Part of VNL project.

## Requirements and Installation
`stac-mjx` relies on `jax`, which has different versions based on your platform (CPU/GPU/TPU), so build within an environment with `jax` installed. 

* Install the rest of the prerequisites using the included setup script with
```
pip install .
```
* temp: to make sure the environment works, run `python3 setup_test.py`; if there are no errors, you're all set!
